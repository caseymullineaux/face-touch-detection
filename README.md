# COVID-19 prevention with python

## Introduction

We're a few months into COVID-19 lockdown and working from home has become a reality for a lot of us. The World Health Organization advises that in order to protect ourselves from infection, we should avoid touching our eys, nose and mouth as much as possible.

Driven by the internet's enthusiasm to videos of themselves struggling to keep their hands away from their faces, I decided to embark on a little project to help me detect exactly when that happens throughout the course of a regular work-from-home day.

This project causes your computer to scream at you whenever your hands come near your face.
